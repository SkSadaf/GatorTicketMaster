GatorTicketMaster is a Python-based ticket reservation system that efficiently manages seat reservations, waitlists, and priority-based assignments. The project utilizes red black tree, min heap and max heap data structures to manage seat reservations, waitlists, and user priorities efficiently. 

Program Structure:  

The GatorTicketMaster system has the following classes:  
• Node: Represents a node in Red Black tree. 
• RedBlackTree: Implements a Red Black tree for efficient storage and retrieval of reservations.  
• MinHeap: The MinHeap class is an implementation of a binary min heap data structure.  
• MaxHeap: The MaxHeap class implements a binary max heap data structure  
• GatorTicketMaster: The main class that integrates all components and provides the core functionality
